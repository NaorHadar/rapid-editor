# Known Issues:

 - Need to make add sub-modules so everyone can compile and run the program.
   (For now, you'll need to change the build.bat and add SDL2 + gl3w for the program to compile)
 - For now, everything is unoptimized, the first step is to let everything work (all the basic functionality),
   after that, we will refactor the code and optimize it and add features that are in the trello.
